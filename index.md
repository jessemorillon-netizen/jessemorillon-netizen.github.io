### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a favorite because I was always curious about coding got started. Lab 1 was the first lab I ever did and it helped me get into coding. It may have been a very simple code that only printed names but it opened my eyes to coding.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was also a favorite because it was the first real coding assignment I ever did. The code was to calculate the BMI in men and women at diffrent ages. It was the first coding assignment where I was making something you could actually use.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11 was another favorite because it was where code started getting more complicated. It was a code to calculate population densities of different states. I enjoyed writing this code because it really challenged my coding knowledge.
